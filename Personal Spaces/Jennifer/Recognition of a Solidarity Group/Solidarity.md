# Solidarity

For the purpose of this description, solidarity means people standing together as one entity. It means that each member looks to support every other member as much as possible, because every member is needed for the entire group to succeed in its purpose. Therefore, it is in the interest of each individual and the entire group to look to support each other as equals.
