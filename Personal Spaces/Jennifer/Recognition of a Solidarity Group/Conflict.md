# Conflict

In a solidarity group, conflict is understood to be natural and an opportunity for the group to become more whole. Conflict is resolved peacefully by the group. If the group is not able to resolve the conflict peacefully, facilitation is sought from outside the group to resolve the conflict peacefully to the satisfaction of everyone involved.
