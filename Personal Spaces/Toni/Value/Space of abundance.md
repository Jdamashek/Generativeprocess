# Space of abundance

Abundance is promoted by using the creation of artificial scarcity only for preventing the possibility of inhabitants/participants introducing/performing roles that just extract value from the space and/or damage its regenerative nature. Artificial scarcity is only accepted for the creation/enforcement of win more- win more scenarios.
