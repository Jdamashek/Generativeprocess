# Governance Model

A governance model is used to guide the unfolding of the shared generative sequence. The governance model is applied to the sequence transformations (see GENSEQ: Maturing a Generative Sequence) . Any change to the generative sequence, initiated by a collaborator who is engaged through governed collaboration, is governed by the governance model.
