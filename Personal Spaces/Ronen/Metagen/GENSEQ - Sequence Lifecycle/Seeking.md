# Seeking

Aspiration changes your relationship to confusion and stuckness. It shifts you from seeking a patch or a workaround to seeking a deeper understanding for a better way to do what you set out to do. This elevated quality of seeking has the potential to transform the confusing friction into a flowing inquiry. Instead of asking “what do I need to do to get this done?” you may ask “if I did this again, how would I do it better?”
