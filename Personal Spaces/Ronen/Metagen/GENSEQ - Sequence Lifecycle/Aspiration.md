When you feel lost or confused in relation to a task, it may be because you are unaware yet that you are seeking a generative sequence. The most basic function of a generative sequence is to guide to you what to do next. When you are lost and don’t know what to do next, it is likely because a generative sequence is not available to you. A potential for a generative sequence is born when you realize that you are missing it. A potential for a generative sequence is born when you become aware of and tend to the meta-quality of the question: “what to do next?”
