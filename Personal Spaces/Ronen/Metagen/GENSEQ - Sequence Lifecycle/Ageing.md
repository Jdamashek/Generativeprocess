# Ageing

As a generative sequence is shared and applied by others it enters an ageing cycle. It has the potential to continue to slowly refine over time. Copies of the process may be formed as other people apply the process and make subtle changes to adapt it to different contexts. Some copies may live a long life and some may fade out of use.
