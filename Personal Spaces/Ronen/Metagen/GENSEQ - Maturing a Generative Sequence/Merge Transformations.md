# Merge Transformations

Two transformation can be merged together into one. A transformation can be made either forward or backward in the sequence:

-   A forward transformation will insert an earlier (in the sequence) transformation into the later transformation and the earlier transformation will be deleted.
-   A backward transformation will insert a later (in the sequence) transformation into the earlier and the later transformation will be deleted.
