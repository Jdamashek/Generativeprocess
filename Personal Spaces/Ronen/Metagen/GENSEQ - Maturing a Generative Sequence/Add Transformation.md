# Add Transformation

An additional transformation is added to the generative sequence:

-   A transformation added in the beginning clarifies the context of the sequence and its wholeness.
-   A transformation added at the end of a sequence extends the scope of the context and goes deeper into it.
-   A transformation added between existing transformations generates internal elaboration.
